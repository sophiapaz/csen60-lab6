What's the difference between how your website was rendered in Lab 4 vs Lab 6?

In lab4, the website was rendered using client-side rendering. This is when a user is requesting a site and the server seds the html files with javascript links. The brower parses the HTML, contructs the DOM, and downloads the css and js files. Then the browser is fully loaded. It is rendered locally.

In lab6, the website was rendered using server-side rendering. When the user requests a site, the server creates the html files and renders it. The browsers then download the JS and execute it. This is us creating our own server for the website!
